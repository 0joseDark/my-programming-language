## Which is Better? **CPU** or **GPU**?

There’s no single answer,  
just like there’s no one hoe for all soils.  
It depends on what you want to cultivate,  
and how you want to split the work.

### CPU: The Jack-of-All-Trades

The **CPU** is like a wise old man:  
does everything, calmly and precisely.  
Ideal for **complex tasks**,  
with lots of decisions,  
lots of logic,  
and paths that change at every step.

- Great for **control**, **sequencing**, **interpretation**.  
- Few cores, but **very versatile**.  
- Excellent at solving problems **one at a time**, but with intelligence.

### GPU: The Mass Worker

The **GPU** is like a battalion of workers:  
a thousand arms doing the same task with brute force.

Made for **parallel tasks**,  
like **image processing**, **neural networks**,  
or **large-scale simulations**.

- Hundreds or thousands of simple cores.  
- A specialist at doing **many identical things** at once.  
- Ideal for **splitting identical tasks**, without complications.

### So... Which is Better for Splitting Tasks?

It depends:

- **Varied tasks with complex logical decisions?**  
  👉 Go with the **CPU**.

- **Identical, highly parallel tasks, like adding, multiplying, filtering?**  
  👉 Go with the **GPU**.

But if you have both, use both —  
and let each do what it does best.  
**Now *that* is splitting with wisdom.**
