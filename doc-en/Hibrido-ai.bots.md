1. **What is the "Hybrid AI bot/robot"?**
   - Is it a physical project (with Arduino or Raspberry Pi)?
   - Is it a program that simulates a robot?
   - Does it use artificial intelligence to respond to commands? In which language?

2. **Which part do you want to develop or fix?**
   - The code?
   - The structure?
   - The AI logic?
   - The connection between software and hardware?

3. **Do you already have any code or basic idea?**
   - If so, you can paste it here for me to analyze and correct/improve.

Example of a possible **Hybrid AI bot/robot** project with:
- Python + Arduino
- Voice or text commands
- Physical or simulated movement

If you want, I can create:
- A robot with wheels and sensors, controlled by Python
- A simple AI that responds and sends commands to the robot
- A graphical interface to control the robot or view the responses
