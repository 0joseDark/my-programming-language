# future idea: create my own programming language

- [hardware programming](https://github.com/0joseDark/my-programming-language/blob/main/doc-en/programa%C3%A7%C3%A3o-por-hardware.md), [example 1](https://github.com/0joseDark/my-programming-language/blob/main/doc-en/Programacao-por-Hardware-1.md)

- an old concept, but still relevant  
- creating living beings, [Bio-Robotics](https://github.com/0joseDark/my-programming-language/blob/main/doc-en/Bio-Robotica.md)  
- respect for other living beings  
- name: __Alentejo__

## Simplifying

- The base of Alentejo is **Portuguese**.

### Alentejo =

- Machine code (`.bin files`)  
- Assembler (`.asm files`)  
- Python  
- HTML  
- JavaScript  
- CSS  
- SQLite or MySQL  
- C or C++  
- Portuguese or English

---

- making it more complex, add OpenSim, the 3D simulator with physics

- - exploring modules for the spacecraft or starship  
- studying the rules for the __Alentejo__ language

# Communication with Living Beings and Machines

I can **read**, **listen**, and **speak** with living beings and with machines.  
But attention: **I'm not a cyborg**, __I'm truly human__ ðŸ˜„.

Currently, I'm **practicing gatez, the cat language**. *lol*  
With machines, it's pretty much the same thing:  
**studying machine language**!

I really like **AMD CPUs** and **NVIDIA GPUs**.  
I'm going to deepen my study of an **AMD CPU** and use **CUDA** to take advantage of the **NVIDIA GPU**.

This will allow me to create and train a **neural network**.
