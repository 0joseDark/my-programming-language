### What is Bio-Robotics?  
**Bio-Robotics** is an interdisciplinary field that combines biology, robotics, and engineering to develop devices and systems inspired by biology. These systems may include:  

- **Prostheses and Exoskeletons**: Robotic devices that help people with physical disabilities regain movement.  
- **Bio-Inspired Robots**: Machines that mimic animals or living organisms to improve mobility, efficiency, or environmental adaptation.  
- **Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMI)**: Technologies that connect the human brain to electronic devices for direct control.  
- **Biomedical Nanorobots**: Small robots designed to operate inside the human body, assisting in medical treatments such as drug delivery and tissue repair.  

Bio-robotics has applications in medicine, industry, and space exploration, helping to improve quality of life and expand human capabilities.

### Is it possible to rewrite DNA?  
Yes, **DNA editing** is a reality thanks to technologies like **CRISPR-Cas9**, which allows genetic sequences to be modified with high precision. This process can be used to:  

- **Correct genetic mutations** responsible for hereditary diseases.  
- **Create genetically modified organisms (GMOs)**, such as pest-resistant plants.  
- **Produce personalized gene therapies** to treat diseases like cancer.  

Despite its potential, genetic editing raises ethical and safety concerns, especially when it comes to modifying human embryos. Therefore, regulations in this field are still under development.
