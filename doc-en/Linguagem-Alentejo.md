# Language: Alentejo

## Low, Very Low-Level Language

In Alentejo, people speak slowly... and so does the code.  
It’s raw language, machine-like — no frills.  
There are no luxuries here, just bits and bytes,  
commands going straight to the heart of the machine.

## Listening to the Machines

Learning to listen to them —  
from the whisper of **machine code**  
to the binary echo that resonates in the **register**.  
They are heard with patience, with care.  
Each instruction, a command.  
Each cycle, a beat.

## Digital Electronics

Taming logic with wires and current.  
It’s the use of **controllers**,  
the dance of **motors**,  
the scent of **sensors**,  
and the voices of **communication**.

Commands that move things.  
Current that comes alive.  
Gates that open and close with purpose.

## Linux Cluster → Swarm of Bots/Robots

And when the fields fill with silicon,  
a **swarm** is born.  
Bots and robots working together,  
like digital reapers.

A **Linux cluster**,  
where each node talks to another,  
synchronized like a GPS-guided herd.
